# Gem City JS
[Gem City JS](http://gemcityjs.com/) is a [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Gem-City-JS/) for web developers who share a desire to learn more about JavaScript.

## Setup Project Locally
* Make sure you have bundler installed by running `bundle -v`
   * The output should look something like this: `Bundler version 2.0.1`
   * If there is no output, run: `gem install bundler`
* Install Gems with `bundle install`
* Start the site with `bundle exec jekyll serve`

## Tools
The Gem City JS site is a onepager using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). We decided to use this static site generator since it is easy and efficient to maintain, especially with all of the data associated with each meetup i.e. the date, the speaker, the topic etc.
